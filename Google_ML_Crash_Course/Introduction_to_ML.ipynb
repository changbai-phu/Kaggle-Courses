    "    - Predicts a numeric value. \n",
    "    - e.g., future house price, future amount of rain etc.\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "    - Predicts the likelihood that something belongs to a category.\n",
    "    - e.g., if an email is spam, if a photo contains a cat etc.\n",
    "    - Binary classification : output a value from a clss that contains only 2 values.\n",
    "        - e.g., cat or dog, rain or no rain\n",

    "    - diversity \n",
    "    - large size and high diversity data would be ideal\n",
    "- Model\n",
    "    - the model learns the mathematical relationship between the features and the label so that it can make the best predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "    - give the model a dataset with labeled examples \n",
    "- Training\n",
    "    - loss: difference btween predicted and actual values\n",
    "    1. the model takes in a single labeled example (from the dataset) and provides a prediction.\n",
    "    2. the model compares predicted value with the actual value (label) and updates the solution of the predicted value.\n",
    "    3. the model repeats this process for each labeled example in the dataset.\n",
    "    - During training, we can select features (that may have more predictive power) to adjust the model for experiments. \n",
    "- Evaluating\n",
    "    1. Use a trained ML model to predict values from a given datasets (only give the features) with labeled examples.\n",
    "    2. Compare predicted values with actual values (label).\n",
    "- Inference \n",
    "    - Use the model we finished training to make predictions on unlabeled examples."
