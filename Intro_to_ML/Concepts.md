Basic concepts
1. Overview
- fitting/training model: we need to use data to predict price, the step of capturing patterns
    from data is training the model.
- training data: data used to fit the model
- how to fit the model
- validate if model works on data other than test data 

2. Decision Tree
- more "splits" (if conditions) - called "deeper" tree
- leaf: the final prediction we make (bottom of the tree)
